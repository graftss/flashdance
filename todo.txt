=== on deck ===
- make the progress bar progress wobble up and down at all times

- grid columns/rows in course data?

- practice mode (needs to be its own state i think)
  - first menu takes you to a "builder" thing where you drag and drop
    attacks into a sequence.
  - can save configs by name
  - add button in game to go back to builder

- "long hold" flash mechanic
  - animation is a growing light that fills out the cell to let you know
    you can stop holding
  - not sure if this is a good idea

- queue a pause during a round that pauses after the round's over

- display CourseResult stats in menu and in game somehow

=== loooong term ===

- currency to buy upgrades like +0.01% delay or something, something
  totally unnoticeable and worthless but it takes a ton of currency to
  buy it and you don't know how little it's going to help until afte
  ryou buy it. lmfao

=== colorblind ===
- make a different shape for fake flashes

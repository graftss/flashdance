=== up next ===
- error when multiflash is clicked too fast apparently
- why are the fakes always slightly after the flashes in a `flashAndFake`
- refactor base sequencer so that the generic methods can be told their
  parameters, (e.g. set path length or set # of fake flashes) via arguments

=== on deck ===
- paths of set lengths in base actino sequencer ? ?? ? ? < ?

- opening titles

- practice mode slider only goes up to highest difficulty completed

- difficulties: easy, medium, hard
  - easy = current tutorial
  - medium = courses using 2-3 effects
  - hard = hard stuff . idk,, go nuts
  - "arcade" mode after beating hard thats totally random

- replace x,y,w,h crap with rects

- put a cool texture on the progress bar maybe

- "long hold" flash mechanic
  - animation is a growing light that fills out the cell to let you know
    you can stop holding
  - not sure if this is a good idea

- display CourseResult stats in menu and in game somehow
  - use another `CourseListMenu` for this i think

=== loooong term ===

- currency to buy upgrades like +0.01% delay or something, something
  totally unnoticeable and worthless but it takes a ton of currency to
  buy it and you don't know how little it's going to help until afte
  ryou buy it. lmfao

=== colorblind ===
- make a different shape for fake flashes

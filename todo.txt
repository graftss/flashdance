- "wait" action, just waits for duration


- "fake" flash (not part of input, just a decoy or whatever)
- "number" on flash to denote multiple taps
- "drag" flash that's like paths in the old game but using touch input

- currency to buy upgrades like +0.01% delay or something, something
  totally unnoticeable and worthless but it takes a ton of currency to
  buy it and you don't know how little it's going to help until afte
  ryou buy it. lmfao

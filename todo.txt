=== up next ===


=== on deck ===
- do something to get rid of repeated grid positions in action sequencers

- put a cool texture on the progress bar maybe

- practice mode (needs to be its own state i think)
  - choose existing course, and your own `minDifficulty` and `maxDifficulty`
    with a double-ended slider (like twitch clip selector)

- "long hold" flash mechanic
  - animation is a growing light that fills out the cell to let you know
    you can stop holding
  - not sure if this is a good idea

- display CourseResult stats in menu and in game somehow

=== loooong term ===

- currency to buy upgrades like +0.01% delay or something, something
  totally unnoticeable and worthless but it takes a ton of currency to
  buy it and you don't know how little it's going to help until afte
  ryou buy it. lmfao

=== colorblind ===
- make a different shape for fake flashes

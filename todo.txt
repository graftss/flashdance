=== up next ===
- simultaneous fake flashes alongside a real one

=== on deck ===
- transitions:
  - complete a course, back to menu
  - fail a course, back to menu

- some visual indication of whether the input is being shown to you, or
  whether you can start recording your own input

- "long hold" flash mechanic
  - animation is a growing light that fills out the cell to let you know
    you can stop holding
  - not sure if this is a good idea

- there should still be some kind of trail behind paths
  - probably solid though, not the dots like before

- queue a pause during a round that pauses after the round's over

- course mode:
  - x lives to make it through y rounds which are themed around certain
    obstacles or length or flashes or whatever.
  - eg one course to introduce each new mechanic
=== loooong term ===

- currency to buy upgrades like +0.01% delay or something, something
  totally unnoticeable and worthless but it takes a ton of currency to
  buy it and you don't know how little it's going to help until afte
  ryou buy it. lmfao

=== colorblind ===
- make a different shape for fake flashes

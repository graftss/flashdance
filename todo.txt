=== up next ===
- differentiate `down` and the start of a drag in `GameInput`?
- show drag action
- show click and drag input graphically, steal ideas from elsewhere
  -> (simon for click)

=== on deck ===
- "fake" flash (not part of input, just a decoy or whatever)
  -> still need to distinguish it achromatically (cool word gahaha)
- "number" on flash to denote multiple taps
- "drag" flash that's like paths in the old game but using touch input
  -> draw this action somehow.

- add something to visually distinguish orientations of the grid
  - probably differently-colored and -shaped objects on each corner,
    or just around the maze in general

- make sure the cell sits at the end of the path
  - impose minimum waiting length at the start and end i guess

- pause between rounds

- pixel-perfect trail positioning

- lint types.d.ts
- rename `inputDragTarget` -> `inputDragOver`
=== loooong term ===

- currency to buy upgrades like +0.01% delay or something, something
  totally unnoticeable and worthless but it takes a ton of currency to
  buy it and you don't know how little it's going to help until afte
  ryou buy it. lmfao

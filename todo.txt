  - first menu takes you to a "builder" thing where you drag and drop
    attacks into a sequence.

  - add button in game to go back to builder
=== on deck ===
- polish incorrect input visuals, maybe have it shrink to a point


- some visual indication of whether the input is being shown to you, or
  whether you can start recording your own input

- "long hold" flash mechanic
  - animation is a growing light that fills out the cell to let you know
    you can stop holding
  - not sure if this is a good idea

- there should still be some kind of trail behind paths
  - probably solid though, not the dots like before

- queue a pause during a round that pauses after the round's over

- course mode:
  - x lives to make it through y rounds which are themed around certain
    obstacles or length or flashes or whatever.
  - eg one course to introduce each new mechanic
=== loooong term ===

- currency to buy upgrades like +0.01% delay or something, something
  totally unnoticeable and worthless but it takes a ton of currency to

  ryou buy it. lmfao

=== colorblind ===
- make a different shape for fake flashes

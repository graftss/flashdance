- replace x,y,w,h crap with rects

- white filler between sldiers in double slider

- put a cool texture on the progress bar maybe

- "long hold" flash mechanic
  - animation is a growing light that fills out the cell to let you know
    you can stop holding
  - not sure if this is a good idea

- display CourseResult stats in menu and in game somehow
  - use another `CourseListMenu` for this i think

=== loooong term ===

- currency to buy upgrades like +0.01% delay or something, something
